# News-Aggregator

## Objective
It is a pilot project that I developed for my academic course DBMS CS-305. 

## Requirements

1) Apache server
2) PHP 7.0.X
3) MySQL 

## How to deploy the website

After installing the requirements, just copy and paste files inside htdocs folder to htdocs on your local system.
Run the SQL scripts provided in sql folder.

Start Apache server and MySQL daemons.
If everything run successfully. Open your browser. Type localhost:PORT_NO (Instead of PORT_NO write the port your Apache server is running).

If you are able to see the index page then everything is running fine. 

Now you can make the Website your own, Integrate Rich content provider API! (check webhose.io)
